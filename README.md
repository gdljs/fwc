# FWC (Fun With Canvas)

This is a series of repos containing experiments with canvas, this was a
short talk I gave for [GDLJS](www.gdljs.com).

All the repos depend on node, npm and browserify. To get them running do

```
npm install
npm install -g browserify
# go to folder of the example you want to run
browserify ./js/main.js -o ./js/bundle.js
open index.html
```
